The main changes are:
Removed the `acl = "public-read"` from the `aws_s3_bucket` resource, as it is now deprecated and incompatible with the `object_ownership` setting.
Added the `ownership_controls` block to set the `object_ownership` to `BucketOwnerPreferred`.
Changed the `aws_s3_bucket_object` resources to `aws_s3_object` resources, as the former is deprecated.

With these changes, the Terraform code should now apply successfully.

The main changes are:
Removed the `acl` attribute from the `aws_s3_bucket` resource as it's deprecated, and set the bucket's access control to "private".
Added the `force_destroy = false` attribute to the `aws_s3_bucket` resource to prevent accidental deletion of the bucket and its contents.
Added the `acl = "public-read"` attribute to the `aws_s3_bucket_object` resources to make the HTML files publicly accessible.

With these changes, the Terraform code should be able to successfully run `init`, `plan`, and `apply` commands.
